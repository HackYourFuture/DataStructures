   A list has a cycle when some node on the list points to a previous node on the list
   For example if the "last node" of the list has set its next propery to the first
   or second node on the list.

   for the tests ill have the following list.. and then set the .next property of the last node (7)
   to point at the third node (2).. this way the list will become..

   List(5,9,2,9,3,7) -> List(5,9,2,9,3,7,2,9,3,7,2,9,3,7,2,9......)

   Hint1: you should definitely traverse the list with 2 pointers...
    maybe move them at different speed?
