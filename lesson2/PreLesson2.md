# Introduction

No intro here, by now you know what to do üòù. We are going to see Linked lists (singly linked list),
more algorithm complexity theory and do some fun challenges.
# Pre-Lesson Readings <a name="pre-reading"></a>

1. [Linked list video(and what happens in memory)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NobHlGUjV3g)
2. [Linked List on JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YddVVsdG5A)
3. [Big 0 notation (algorithmic complexity)](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/)
4. [Mindblowingly good stackoverflow response to What is Big O](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/what-is-a-plain-english-explanation-of-big-o-notation)


# Pre-Lesson Exercises <a name="pre-exercises"></a>

## tl;dr version
1. Clone this repo
2. open a terminal inside lesson2 folder
3. npm install
4. npm test

If everything goes OK test will start and fail, you will have to make them pass.

## Long version

**Lists**

linked_list/lists.js is a non fully implemented Linked List.
Your goal is to implement all the methods you read about in the pre class reading.


**List Problems**

Still working on this..üòÖ might be some of the following:

* Find if a linked list has a loop (or a cycle)
* Find the average of all numbers in a Linked List
* Implement Stack with Linked List
* Implement Stack using Queues
