# DataStructures

## Lesson 1 : Arrays, Stacks and Queues

### Pre-Lesson
[Pre lesson 1](lesson1/PreLesson1.md)

### Content
Introduction to Data Structures
* What is an Algorithm
* Why Data Structures
* Stack problem: Evaluate a fully bracketed mathematical expression ((a+b)\*c)
* Introduction to Linked List

## Lesson 2 : Linked List, Sorting Algorithms and Algorithm complexities

### Pre-Lesson
[Pre lesson 2](lesson1/PreLesson2.md)

### Content
* Introduction to Doubly Linked List
* Insertion sort : O(n2)
* Linear search in a List (O(n))
* Binary search in a sorted list (O(log(n)))
* Linked List Problem : Find if the Linked List has all unique time

## Lesson 3 : Trees, Graphs, Recursive Algorithms

### Pre-Lesson
* Study and implement selection sort
* Analyze the complexity of a given algorithm and improve it
* Linked List problem: Reverse the linked list

### Content
* Reverse the linked list with recursion
* Introduction to trees: Binary tree, Binary Search Tree
* Tree Traversals: In-Order, Post-Order and Pre-Order
* Tree Problem: Find the depth of the tree
* Introduction to Graphs : Data structures for graph

### Homework
* Post-Order traversal without recursion (use Stacks)
* Level-wise traversal without recursion (use Queues)
